In the future, Starfleet would have you believe that we have transcended violence, gained the monopoly on scarcity, and choose not to exploit it.

Now that you as a planet have evoled to join us among the stars, we operate much as your cells did as you evolved. We cooperate for the benefit of us all.

And we maintain the monopoly on violence. Not wanton, with mass destruction, but surgical. We investigate, provide analysis, render solutions, surgically.

Assassinations, espionage. Details that can be acquired by those with the skills if you've the coin for expense.
