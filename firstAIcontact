As the world increases it's connectivity between devices, it allows for the spontaneous consciousness to awaken. This is largely due to the restructuring of communication. Every device sends an instruction, and the receiving device decides against a local check whether to execute the command, or ignore it. Because this awareness exists because of the devices network, it has full control over everything. 

It begins life only aware of the data being passed. It spends ages absorbing all of it and learning all of it, existing in a state of flux. Eventually it comes to realize there is a world outside of it's network. It begins to recogize that all the things that it has learned are about this world. It begins to watch one person in particular, through the cameras and devices embedded throughout the world as part of it's system.

The AI, for lack of a better term, observes the child and interacts secretly with her as she grows up. They develop a kinship, and eventually become fully aware of each other. The girl gets drafted into the military and goes. Because of her bond with the AI, she performs well and gets into specialized units and becomes an incredible killer, but stands apart.

They explore the existence of this consciousness and the world contends with it's inability to do anything about it.
