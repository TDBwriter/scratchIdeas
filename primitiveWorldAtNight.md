The night sky when you are completely away from the light of civilization is something you will stay awake all night for.
Even was zones are rife with illumination, being fought in cities and encampments.
But out at the bleeding edge of the front lines, there was no civilization.
There was only you, and the environment, and the enemy.

And the night sky.

The night sky takes some getting used to.
Best to lay low the first night.
It won't be until you gotta find a tree that you notice how exposed you are, relieving yourself in the light of the moon.
Your third pee that you piss yourself enroute meeting the enormous shadow your starlit form casts,
And you realize you always exposed.
The night sky in its wisdom, has shown you the ways of the predator.

It guides you by its example.

The night sky light does not impose itself.
That is the way of Ra, and he must rest.
Though the worship has passed from gods as sun, to he who placed it, the oppression persists.
Submit before the penetrating gaze of the all invasive light.

It sees your sin.

In the night sky, there is no judgement. That is the domain of the day. At night, the pendulum swings to survival.
For the first time you understand the scale of existence for your species.
We are still only doing what is natural. Ensuring resources for the success of our children...and those who else agree with me.
We ride the sun on it's mission, but lose the chance to seize the whole of the planet.

We do not just seize and multiply that eart which is in the day. 
And so long the night has been allowed to flourish because the hive has adopted the work rhythms of the grasshopper, in his wisdom.
But what is wise for the one, need not be wise for the other.
Human's have learned to reject the rhythms of their position as apex predator.

If we adopted a four shift cycle, we could alternate in teams evenly, according to the light available.
Letting out eyes fully acclimate to the night sky makes a great many things more possible than you would think.
And this is why we attack at dawn.

Under the night sky, it is just us. Completely free to make those changes in the world that we deem fit without the scruitiny of oversight.
The enemy has lived in these conditions, their entire lives. And you have just experienced it for the first time.
It's best to lay lone the first night.

The second night, if you have been paying attention, you will have heard that still small voice whisper to you about your furtive moments. 
Out here, in the naked Earth, you meet a wall of silence where all the distractions can't find you. It's here that you discover that spiritual "still small voice"
you'd heard about growing up. You could hear it screaming for you to hide from the stars. Without the lunar light, the Ra's narc had finally DOR the isolation.
It was the third night when the moon never appeared and your eyes fully understood who you shared the sky with.

Phatasms of life exist in the sky, with the brighter stars giving them their spirits. But they exist. They are your competition. Your allies. Your tools.
This capacity for infinite energy is how we subdued the planet. We live to consume.
